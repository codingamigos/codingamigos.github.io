# codingamigos.github.io
The CodingAmigos are a loose bunch of coders, activists, creators and anything in between. The meetup is less of a formal meeting, more like a hangout to get to know interesting people, work on your own projects and chat about tech and the world.

## Meetup Values
• 1. We follow the berlin code of conduct

• 2. In order not to exclude anyone, english or code are the mandatory languages :)

• 3. We aim to support each other

• 4. We try to encourage equal amount of sharing and talking in our meetups

• 5. Everyone tries to help shy people get introduced to others and to include everyone in the conversations

• 6. We promote inclusiveness no matter what gender, age, knowledge level or any other background a person is

• 7. Everyone tries to be a person who makes other people around her/him feel nice
